Focus

Focus is a calm, body-double based Pomodoro study app designed to help students maintain focus while avoiding burnout.
It emphasizes gentle structure, presence, and sustainable study habits instead of pressure or gamification.

Overview

Most Pomodoro apps either:

Over-gamify productivity and create pressure, or

Ignore mental fatigue and burnout completely

Focus takes a different approach.
It uses a silent, visual body-double to accompany users during focus sessions and reflect their overall work–rest rhythm without interruptions or guilt.
